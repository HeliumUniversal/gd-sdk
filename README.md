This is repository for Helium's Geometry Dash Hooks and Patchs Framework

So, how start:

This is only compatible with Helium's toolchain, and my own toolchain, so it can be compatible with the [cocos2d headers](https://github.com/HeliumUniversal/cocos2d-x) and the [framework](https://github.com/HeliumUniversal/framework).

For using this framework, you need:

Any C++ compiler, i use Visual Studio Community 2019's MSBuild

Visual Studio Code (or any text editor)

CMake (or a generator that converts that code to Visual Studio Community 2019 (in my case), or clang (another c++ compiler) )

Knowledge of C, C++

For Java:

Eclipse (or another IDE for Java)

Apache Maven



This framework uses:

Cocos2d (our cocos2d framework works best)

My [Patcher](https://github.com/Adrikikicp/Patcher)

Our modification of [fmt](https://github.com/HeliumUniversal/fmt) (for funkin)
